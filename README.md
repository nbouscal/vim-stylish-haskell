vim-stylish-haskell
===================

Introduction
------------

This is a plugin to integrate [stylish-haskell] cleanly into your vim
workflow. By default, it will run stylish-haskell on Haskell buffers every
time they are saved. It assumes stylish-haskell is accessible from your $PATH.
If this isn't the case, set the `g:stylish_haskell_command` variable to the
location of the stylish-haskell binary.
